        bool "Use coin cell button"
        default y
        help
            By default, this demo uses the coin cell button to control the bulb, but if you don't have such button, you can use other ESP32 series DevKit to simulate, if so, please set this option to N.

    config EXAMPLE_SWITCH_STATUS_PERSISTED
        bool "Persist switch status in nvs"
        default n
        help
            If switch status is persisted in nvs, status value is stored in nvs and represents ON or OFF. If it is not persisted, status value represents TOGGLE.
